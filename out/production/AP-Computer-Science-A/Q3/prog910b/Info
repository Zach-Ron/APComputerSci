PROGRAM 910b
(covering all the bases)

Program Description:  Write a program that prints a conversion for a variety of numbers as specified by the user.
 The conversion from base 10 to some other base will be in the range base 2 through base 16.

The principle of conversion includes the following steps:

Carry out successive divisions by the new base until a quotient is obtained that is less than the new base.

The ones digit corresponds to the first remainder.
The next digit corresponds to the remainder after the quotient has been divided by the base again.
The most significant digit is the first quotient less than the base.

Thus 83 [base 10] is 123 [base 8]  	83/8 = 10	remainder 3
				10/8  =  1	remainder 2
				1/8    =  0	remainder 1

Notice that the numbers are written in reverse order of their calculations indicating that a-
recursive function may be the best way to proceed.

Statements Required:  input, output, decision making

Exact copy:
Enter the number base 10 to convert:  255
Enter the new base:  16
The number 255 [base 10] = FF [base 16]

Enter the number base 10 to convert:  256
Enter the new base:  16
The number 255 [base 10] = 100 [base 16]

Enter the number base 10 to convert:  34
Enter the new base:  8
The number 255 [base 10] = 42 [base 8]

Enter the number base 10 to convert:  100
Enter the new base:  3
The number 255 [base 10] = 10201 [base 3]

Enter the number base 10 to convert:  1034
Enter the new base:  12
The number 255 [base 10] = 722 [base 12]
